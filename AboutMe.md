- 👋 Hi, I’m Ionescu Ionut
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to cold and helping others. I like to go to the gym and run since it challenges me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#. I've learned Python, Java, HTML and CSS and have certificates in all of them.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can help out with. So just reach out to me. I currently just started with Github so you will have to excuse my inexpertise.
- 📫 In my profile I linked my twitter. But if you want to reach me fast then reach me by my discord. My tag is Ionut#0699.

So guess I will say a bit about myself over here. I've learned how to code well in school, but I liked to learn by myself as well. Because of that I managed to
certify myself more than planned. Currently I want to learn how to use GitHub and help others, it would be amazing to be part of someones project and help them out.
